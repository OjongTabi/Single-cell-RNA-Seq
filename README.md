# SingleCellRNASeqAnalysis

This project involves replicating and extending the findings of the Baron et al. study, which explores the cellular diversity in the human pancreas via single-cell RNA-Seq analysis. 

## Phases
1. **Process Single Cell Sequencing Reads and Choose Barcodes**: Processing barcode reads and performing cell-by-gene quantification of UMI counts. 

2. **Processing the UMI counts matrix**: Filtering low-quality cells and genes from the UMI counts matrix and identifying clusters of cell type subpopulations. 

3. **Cluster Marker Genes**: Identifying marker genes for each cluster, labeling clusters based on markers, and discovering novel marker genes. 

4. **In-depth Marker Gene Analysis**: For 4-person groups, conducting gene set enrichment analysis on the marker genes for each cluster.

5. **Discuss Findings**: Discussing findings with team members, comparing results to those in the Baron et al. study. 

## Prerequisites
Familiarity with single-cell RNA-Seq analysis, R language, and the Seurat package from Bioconductor is needed.
